Third Week
===========

This week is all about your :ref:`Mini_research_Project` and ends with a 🎉 final presentation 🎉 of your work on Friday. The research projects will be conducted in small teams.

You learned the basics on oribatid mites, heard of some unresolved mysteries and practiced how to analyse molecular data.

.. _Goals_Third_Week:
Major Goals
-----------

Each project-team will build their own hypothesis and collect data, from the course and public repositories, to answer the research question. You will apply the suitable analytical tools and interpret your results in a scientific context. This will be presented by you and discussed (and defended) with the whole group.

.. attention::

  The course will end with the last presentation and a feedback round on Friday. You will not have to write a protocol or paper. **Instead, you will have to answer a questionnaire, individually, on Thursday.**

        .. tab:: Possible research question:

           `Have the body sizes of oribatid mites changed over evolutionary time?` 

  .. tab:: Phylogenetic diversity

     .. tabs::

        .. tab:: Possible research question:

           `Do oribatid mite communities differ between ecosystems and if so, where is phylogenetic diversity (PD) highest?`

These are the research projects you can investigate using phylogenetic trees. Each of the three research areas (phylogenetics, ancestral state reconstruction, phylogenetic diversity) should be covered by the whole course. Come together in small teams of your favourite research area. All teams should be approximately of the same size.

Formulate clear hypotheses that arw testable and refutable. In order to investigate your research question, you need to take small steps. A hypothesis is testing parts of your research question. If you have enough pieces together, you may be able to explain your results. Collect the neccessary data to test your hypothesis and plan how to split the work among each other.

.. note::

  **At the end of the week you will…**

  - Know how to formulate a hypothesis.
  - Where to find and collect data in order to test a hypothesis.
  - Skimmed through some publications that relate to your research topic.
  - Gained practice in handling and analysing molecular data.
  - Apply and intensify the knowledge you gained in the last two weeks.
  - Learned that public data repositories may contain flawed data.
  - Work effectively and cooperatively in small teams.
  - Learned how to interpret preliminary and final data.
  - Interpret results in a scientific context.

Summary
^^^^^^^

First, we will start with repeating what you learned last week. How do you analyse molecular data to obtain a phylogenetic tree! Which analytical steps are necessary and why. What are the different steps doing with your data, which are necessary and which are replaceable. As last week, you will draft mind-maps in small teams. The best mind map will be exhibited in the hallway of our working group.

After discussing open questions, you will start to think about your mini research project.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Exercise 1
          
     - Choose a research topic you are interested in.
     - Find a team with the same interest.

  .. tab:: Exercise 2

     - Formulate hypotheses.
     - Explain you hypotheses! What do you expect and why?
     - Discuss which data you need to test the hypothesis.
     - Discuss the hypothesis and the data with your tutors.
     - Check the literature if other studies investigated similar topics.
     
     .. note::
     
        The tutors will help you to find publications.

  .. tab:: Exercise 3

     - Start to collect and format the data you need.
     - Build task forces and split the work effectively.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Exercise

     - Continue with your :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.
     - Finish collecting and formatting the data you need today.
     - Start the first analyses if possible.
     - Consult the literature.
  
.. attention::

  By the end of the day, you should already have a complete alignment and a best-fit model of sequence evolution.
  
.. tip::

  Ask tutors for help, assistance, and/or advice.

.. _Wednesday_Third_Week:
Wednesday
---------

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Today, keep the finish line of your analyses in sight. Check and discuss preliminary and final results with the tutors. Add or delete taxa/genes if it improves your analyses. Be critical but pragmatic.

  .. tab:: Exercise

     By the end of the day, you should have your final results!

  .. tab:: Keep in mind!

     Make sure that you have looked for and consulted scientific papers that deal with your topic.
