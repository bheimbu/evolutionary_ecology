Third Week
===========

This week is all about your :ref:`Mini_research_Project` and ends with a ðŸŽ‰ final presentation ðŸŽ‰ of your work on Friday. The research projects will be conducted in small teams.

You learned the basics on oribatid mites, heard of some unresolved mysteries and practiced how to analyse molecular data.

.. _Goals_Third_Week:
Major Goals
-----------

Each project-team will build their own hypothesis and collect data, from the course and public repositories, to answer the research question. You will apply the suitable analytical tools and interpret your results in a scientific context. This will be presented by you and discussed (and defended) with the whole group.

.. attention::

  The course will end with the last presentation and a feedback round on Friday. You will not have to write a protocol or paper. **Instead, you will have to answer a questionnaire, individually, on Thursday.**

     .. tabs::

        .. tab:: Background

           You will investigate the phylogenetic diversity (PD) of oribatid mite communities from different ecosystems and test where PD is highest. From this, you may evaluate the value of each ecosystem from a conservation perspective.

These are just general ideas of different research areas you can investigate using phylogenetic trees. Each of the three research areas (phylogenetics, phylogeography, community ecology) should be covered by the whole course. Come together in small teams of your favourite research area. All teams should be approximately of the same size.

Discuss in the group the phenomenon you are most interested in. (Phylogenetics is not a phenomenon, it is a method to investigate a phenomenon.) Formulate a clear hypothesis that is testable and refutable. In order to investigate a phenomenon, you need to take small steps. A phenomenon is a big and complex feature. A hypothesis is testing parts of a phenomenon. If you have enough pieces together, you may be able to explain the phenomenon. Interestingly, not all hypotheses support a phenomenon, which is also a result in itself and helps us figure out why a particular phenomenon exists.

Collect the neccessary data to test your hypothesis and plan how to split the work among each other.

.. note::

  **At the end of the week you willâ€¦**

  - Know how to formulate a hypothesis.
  - Where to find and collect data in order to test a hypothesis.
  - Skimmed through some publications that relate to your research topic.
  - Gained practice in handling and analysing molecular data.
  - Apply and intensify the knowledge you gained in the last two weeks.
  - Learned that public data repositories may contain flawed data.
  - Work effectively and cooperatively in small teams.
  - Learned how to interpret preliminary and final data.
  - Interpret results in a scientific context.

Summary
^^^^^^^

First, we will start with repeating what you learned last week. How do you analyse molecular data to obtain a phylogenetic tree! Which analytical steps are necessary and why. What are the different steps doing with your data, which are necessary and which are replaceable. As last week, you will draft mind-maps in small teams. The best mind map will be exhibited in the hallway of our working group.

After discussing open questions, you will start to think about your mini research project.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. tabs::

  .. tab:: Exercise 1
          
     - Think about a research topic you are interested in.
     - Find a team with the same interest.

  .. tab:: Exercise 2

     - Formulate a hypothesis.
     - Explain the hypothesis, what you expect and why.
     - Discuss which data you need to test the hypothesis.
     - Discuss the hypothesis and the data with your tutors.
     - Check the literature if other studies investigated similar topics.
     
     .. note::
     
        The tutors will help you to find publications.

  .. tab:: Exercise 3

     - Start to collect and format the data you need.
     - Build task forces and split the work effectively.

  .. tab:: Exercise

     - Continue with your :ref:`Mini_research_Project`.
     - Finish collecting and formatting the data you need today.
     - Start the first analyses if possible.
     - Consult the literature.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Today, keep the finish line of your analyses in sight. Check and discuss preliminary and final results with the tutors. Add or delete taxa/genes if it improves your analyses. Be critical but pragmatic.
