Monday
------
Here’s a refined version:

You already know how to collect soil animals (refer to :ref:`how-to-sample` if you need a refresher). By the end of the day, you'll have a collection of various mite species, roughly categorized into distinct morphological types (morphotypes).

In the morning, you’ll receive a general introduction to soil animal systematics and become familiar with common mesofauna representatives. Additionally, you'll get an overview of the taxonomy and phylogeny of oribatid mites, learning about their distinctive body plans and lifestyles, which will help you differentiate them from other mites.

In the afternoon, you'll observe soil fauna firsthand through a stereomicroscope 🔬. While many of the soil animals in your samples will be deceased, the oribatid mites and other taxa will be alive. Oribatid mites exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from agile runners to slow movers, and from tiny, transparent species to large, pitch-black ones. Some are smooth and glassy, while others are coated in dirt. Despite their differences, all oribatid mites share a common trait: an impressive array of defense strategies.

.. tip::
  🔍 Take your time to observe oribatid mites and their characteristic movements and bodies. Write down three to five features (morphological and/or behavioural) of three living oribatid mites you observe. Remember, a character is everything you can observe. What type of defense strategy do the different oribatids display? Save your notes, we will use them later in this course. It may be helpful to make drawings or sketches of the observed species to more easily distinguish morphotypes based on certain character(s).

.. note::
  **By the end of the day, you will be able to identify the most relevant morphological characteristics to distinguish oribatid mites and classify them into appropriate groups.**
    - Differentiate oribatid mites from other mite species.
    - Classify oribatid mites into major groups.
    - Group oribatid mite species based on distinct morphotypes.
    - Identify oribatid mites to the genus level, and potentially to the species level.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Group oribatid mite species based on distinct morphotypes.

	  - Group oribatid mites by morphotypes. You can collect over 10 different morphotypes, at least two are required (use glass dishes filled with ethanol).
	  - Transfer each morphogroup (all individuals belonging to the same morphotype) into a separate vial.
	  - Transfer one or two individuals (depending on your total number) in a glass vial and add a small label.
	  - The remaining individuals (up to eight or more, at least one ore two are required depending on your total number) go into 2 ml tubes. Label them in the same way as the samples in the glass vials.

   .. tab:: Save your notes

          - Write down three to five characters (morphological and/or behavioural) of three oribatid mite species. Keep your notes, we will be using them later in this course.

Tuesday
-------
Goals
^^^^^
Yesterday, you collected oribatid mites that were slowly cooking in lactic acid over night to brighten them for better examination under the microscope. Without this treatment, it would be impossible to recognize important morphological features.

.. note::
  **Today, you will…**
    - deepen your knowledge about how to determine oribatid mites.
    - learn to recognise additional morphological characters.
    - be able to determine most of your specimen to species level.

For the species level identification (using the microscope), please remove one or two individuals from the glass vials; the remaining specimen (in 2 ml reaction tubes) are used for molecular work.

Summary
^^^^^^^
Yesterday, you gained an overview about soil-biodiversity and the most common mesofauna representatives. Today we got a deeper insight into the fascinating world of body shapes and forms that are so characteristic of oribatid mites. You are also familiar with the 'morphotype' concept and able to recognize families and genera of oribatid mites, in some case down to to the species level, by form, shape, and individual characters.
Today, your task is to determine the morphotypes you collected yesterday to the species level (if you didn't do so yesterday). Use only one individual from your morphotype collection and leave the others untouched. Please enter all species you have identified in the common taxa list, including the number of morphotypes.
At the end of the day, the entire class will have a shared collection of oribatid mite species of specific morphotypes; you learned how to label and organise samples and intermediate results (i.e., your shared taxa list) in a transparent and unique way.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. important::
    1. Please enter the sample number, species name, morphotype number, and your name in the common taxa list.
    2. At the end of the day, everyone should have five different species identified.

Wednesday
---------
Summary
^^^^^^^
We start the day with revising what you have learned so far. By today you are able to recognize oribatid mites in general and to sort morphotypes into the six major groups (Palaeosomata, Parhyposomata, Enarthronota, Mixonomata, Desmonomata, and Brachypylina). You can name a handful of characters that are typical for each group and can assign at least one species to at least four of the six major groups. You know where oribatid mites live, and you have a general understanding of their ecology and phylogeny.
After working with oribatid mites on a morphological basis, you now start to work with them on a molecular level. You will get familiar with the general process of DNA extraction and laboratory safety rules. After you successfully extracted and purified your DNA, you start a PCR reaction that is going to run overnight. The DNA extraction includes a long incubation step for ~2 hours. Be prepared to work until after 5:00 pm today.
You learn the principles of DNA extractions and PCR and the different steps that are part of these methods. You will get to know the relevant reagents and what they do.
At the end of the day, you have purified DNA stored in the freezer and a PCR running.

Goals
^^^^^
In this course, we use a DNA extraction method based on spin columns with a silica membrane, provided as a DNA extraction kit. 'Kit' means, that buffers, reaction tubes, incubation, and centrifugation procedures are delicately matched, ensuring easy processing with an optimal outcome (i.e. DNA yield).

.. _first_week_thursday:
Thursday
--------
You have been introduced to the basic and most common methods in molecular work i.e., DNA extraction and PCR. Today you will perform gel electrophoresis to visualize the products of your PCRs. Successful PCR reactions are then purified and sent for sequencing.
At the end of the day, you have completed the wet-lab part of your molecular work. You know the necessary steps to obtain DNA sequences and have a semi-professional understanding of the steps involved, from DNA extraction to purification of the PCR product.
The purified PCR products are sent to a sequencing company that uses the standard Sanger sequencing method.

Goals
^^^^^
Today, you pour an agarose gel and load a small amount of your PCR product onto the gel to check whether your PCR worked or not. Before loading your samples onto the gel, be sure to add loading dye. After checking the gel, purify (i.e., wash) the PCR products with bright and clear bands in order to send them for sequencing.

   - What are the main advantages of the modern fluorescence based Sanger DNA sequencing approach compared to the original (radio-labelled) one.
   - What happens to your PCR primers during Sanger sequencing? Are they even used?
   - Why do we sequence the forward and reverse strands of the PCR product separately? Is it important for the method itself or just helpful for analyzing our data?

Task 2
""""""

Watch `A brief tour of Geneious Prime <https://go.geneious.com/video/getting-started-in-geneious-prime>`_.
If you are going to use your own PC on Monday next week, install the `30-days trial version of Geneious Prime <https://manage.geneious.com/free-trial>`_.

.. note::
  As soon as possible, but latest on Monday next week, you will receive the raw reads of your sequences. Your PCR products were sequenced in forward and reverse direction, meaning that two raw reads form a consensus sequence. In order to obtain a consensus sequence, assemble the pairs of raw reads and – very important! – check for any sequencing errors and/or ambiguous positions. At the end, we want to have good to high quality consensus sequences for downstream analyses.

.. important:: 
  Watch the tutorial about `Sanger Sequencing <https://www.geneious.com/academy/getting-started/?wvideo=0htkkxq986>`_ on the Geneious Academy webpage. It will explain the most important and common terms such as sequence assembly, sequence checking, ambiguous positions, consensus sequence, etc, and explains how to analyze your Sanger sequences.

Task preview for Monday morning, Second Week:
---------------------------------------------

On :ref:`Monday_Second_Week`, each of you will process a subsample of raw reads to assemble good to high quality consensus sequences. A **sequence assignment list** will be provided `here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jLPmKAFAuehtg1MWWZrVGDfeNNqv-mfPGC4dCOA2GbI/edit?usp=sharing>`_ and you can find the **raw sequences** `here <https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/QSFR7r76OLJ5TsS>`_.

.. attention::
 Sequences must to be assembled, checked, and exported as consensus sequence files. Please upload them `here <https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/seFkQ23tcEiTcA7>`_ by Monday 5:00 pm. Each consensus file you upload must contain a sample ID and your initials.

.. tip::
  If you want, you can also start the :ref:`Monday_Second_Week` tutorials and tasks this Friday. You are very welcome to ask questions in class from 11:00-12:00 am and 1:00-2:00 pm and we would be happy to support you in assembling, checking, exporting, and naming your sequences. You can also use Slack to ask questions and discuss them with the others.

.. hint::
  The sequencing facility may work quickly, so raw sequences may be available as early as Saturday/Sunday. If so, the sequence assignment list will be provided at the weekend. If the tutorial is clear enough for you and raw sequences were uploaded on the weekend (please check it yourself), you can start working on the weekend and upload the consensus sequences. In any case, consensus sequences must be uploaded by 5:00 p.m. on Monday or any time earlier.
