.. _first_week_monday:
Monday
------
You already know how to collect soil animals (refer to :ref:`how-to-sample` if you need a refresher). By the end of the day, you'll have a collection of various mite species, roughly categorized into distinct morphological types (morphotypes).

In the morning, you’ll receive a general introduction to soil animal systematics and become familiar with common mesofauna representatives. Additionally, you'll get an overview of the taxonomy and phylogeny of oribatid mites, learning about their distinctive body plans and lifestyles, which will help you differentiate them from other mites.

In the afternoon, you'll observe soil fauna firsthand through a stereomicroscope 🔬. While many of the soil animals in your samples will be deceased, the oribatid mites and other taxa will be alive. Oribatid mites exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from agile runners to slow movers, and from tiny, transparent species to large, pitch-black ones. Some are smooth and glassy, while others are coated in dirt. Despite their differences, all oribatid mites share a common trait: an impressive array of defense strategies.

.. tip::
  🔍 Take your time to observe oribatid mites and their characteristic movements and bodies. Write down three to five features (morphological and/or behavioural) of three living oribatid mites you observe. Remember, a character is everything you can observe. What type of defense strategy do the different oribatids display? Save your notes, we will use them later in this course. It may be helpful to make drawings or sketches of the observed species to more easily distinguish morphotypes based on certain character(s).

.. note::
  By the end of the day, you will be able to identify the most relevant morphological characteristics to distinguish oribatid mites and classify them into separate major groups.
    - Differentiate oribatid mites from other mite species.
    - Classify oribatid mites into major groups.
    - Group oribatid mite species based on distinct morphotypes.
    - Identify oribatid mites to the genus level, and potentially to the species level.

Tasks of the Day

.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Exercise 1

	  1. Transfer all individuals belonging to the same morphotype into a *Blockschälchen* filled with EtOH.

          .. note::

	  2. Transfer one or two individuals into a glass vial and add a small label.
	  3. The remaining individuals go into 2 ml tubes filled with EtOH.
          4. Label them in the same way as the samples in the glass vials.

   .. tab:: Exercise 2

          1. Write down three to five characters (morphological and/or behavioural) of three oribatid mite species.

.. _first_week_tuesday:
Tuesday
-------
Yesterday, you collected oribatid mites and left them in lactic acid overnight to clear their bodies for better examination under the microscope. Without this treatment, recognizing key morphological features would be challenging.

.. note::
  **Today, you will…**
    - Expand your knowledge on how to identify oribatid mites.
    - Learn to recognize additional morphological characters.
    - Be able to identify most of your specimens to species level.

For species-level identification (using the microscope 🔬), take one or two individuals from the glass vials. The remaining specimens (in 2 ml reaction tubes) will be used for molecular work.
