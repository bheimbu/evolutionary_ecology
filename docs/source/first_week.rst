	  - Understand the principles of Sanger sequencing and how to prepare samples for sequencing.

.. _first_week_monday:
Monday
------
You already know how to collect soil animals (refer to :ref:`how-to-sample` if you need a refresher). By the end of the day, you'll have a collection of various mite species, roughly categorized into distinct morphological types (morphotypes).

In the morning, you‚Äôll receive a general introduction to soil animal systematics and become familiar with common mesofauna representatives. Additionally, you'll get an overview of the taxonomy and phylogeny of oribatid mites, learning about their distinctive body plans and lifestyles, which will help you differentiate them from other mites.

In the afternoon, you'll observe soil fauna firsthand through a stereo microscope üî¨. While many of the soil animals in your samples will be deceased, the oribatid mites and other taxa will be alive. Oribatid mites exhibit remarkable diversity, ranging from agile runners to slow movers, and from tiny, transparent species to large, pitch-black ones. Some are smooth and glassy, while others are coated in dirt. Despite their differences, all oribatid mites share a common trait: an impressive array of defense strategies.

.. tip::
  üîç Take your time to observe oribatid mites and their characteristic movements and bodies. Write down three to five features (morphological and/or behavioural) of three living oribatid mites you observe. Remember, a character is everything you can observe. What type of defense strategy do the different oribatids display? Save your notes, we will use them later in this course. It may be helpful to make drawings or sketches of the observed species to more easily distinguish morphotypes based on certain character(s).

.. note::
  By the end of the day, you will be able to identify the most relevant morphological characteristics to distinguish oribatid mites and classify them into separate major groups.
    - Differentiate oribatid mites from other mite species.
    - Classify oribatid mites into major groups.
    - Group oribatid mite species based on distinct morphotypes.
    - Identify oribatid mites to the genus level, and potentially to the species level.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Exercise 1

	  1. Transfer all individuals belonging to the same morphotype into a *Blocksch√§lchen* filled with EtOH.

          .. note::
             You can collect over 10 different morphotypes, but at least two are required.

	  2. Transfer one or two individuals (**from the same morphotype**) into a glass vial and add a small label.
	  3. The remaining morphotype individuals go into 2 ml tubes filled with EtOH.
          4. Label them in the same way as the samples in the glass vials.

   .. tab:: Exercise 2

          1. Write down three to five characters (morphological and/or behavioural) of three oribatid mite species.

          .. note::
             Keep your notes, we will be using them later in this course.

.. tip::
   Just in case, you can view / watch the :ref:`lectures` again at any time.

.. _first_week_tuesday:
Tuesday
-------
Yesterday, you collected oribatid mites and left them in lactic acid overnight to clear their bodies for better examination under the stereo microscope. Without this treatment, recognizing key morphological features would be challenging.

.. note::
  **Today, you will‚Ä¶**
    - Expand your knowledge on how to identify oribatid mites.
    - Learn to recognize additional morphological characters.
    - Be able to identify most of your specimens to species level.

For species-level identification (using the stereo microscope üî¨), take one or two individuals from the glass vials. The remaining specimens (in 2 ml reaction tubes filled with EtOH) will be used for molecular work.

Tasks of the Day
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. tabs::

   .. tab:: Exercise

          Enter the sample number, species name, morphotype number, and your name in the **Taxa List**. `Click here <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1f2YfmZ8EUDxAAwiTYumzwVljEHkKnCqL_cZ02moAgi8/edit?usp=sharing>`_.
          
          .. note::
             Everyone should have five different species identified by the end of the day.

   .. tab:: Question

           Why are we using the undetermined morphospecies for molecular analysis?

.. tip::
   Just in case, you can watch the :ref:`lectures` again at any time.

.. _first_week_wednesday:
Wednesday
---------
In this course, we use a DNA extraction method based on spin columns with a silica membrane, provided as part of a DNA extraction kit. The kit includes carefully matched buffers, reaction tubes, and optimized incubation and centrifugation procedures, ensuring efficient processing and optimal DNA yield.

.. note::
  **You will‚Ä¶**
    - Learn how to work safely and maintain cleanliness in a molecular lab.
    - Learn how to properly use a microliter pipette.
    - Understand how to handle your samples without contaminating the workspace, your samples, or yourself.
    - Learn the names and roles of key chemical substances and conditions for each step of DNA extraction.
    - Gain skills in setting up a PCR efficiently.
    - Understand what a PCR mastermix is.
    - Learn how a PCR reaction works and the role of a thermocycler.

.. tip::
   If you feel stuck, ask someone in class for help.

.. _first_week_thursday:
Thursday
--------
Today, you will prepare an agarose gel and load a small amount of your PCR product to check whether the PCR was successful. Be sure to add loading dye to your samples before loading them onto the gel. After evaluating the gel, purify (i.e., wash) the PCR products that show bright and clear bands, in preparation for sequencing.
