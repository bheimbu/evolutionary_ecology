.. note::
   You can access the handout for the morphological characters `here <https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/gqxcY3Ryuu4FphF>`_. And here is the `Weigmann <https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/68BUcZY1ebW14CN>`_. See also the videos under :ref:`lectures`.

.. attention::
   You can find `here <https://keys.lucidcentral.org/keys/v3/mites/Invasive_Mite_Identification/key/0_Glossary/Mite_Glossary.htm>`_ a glossary of acarine terms, in case you're feeling overwhelmed by all the technical terms in the Weigmann.
